# Design a Playlist

This repository is for project 3 in my STATS 220 course, where I have designed my own playlist and explored data from the iTunes API using R script.

## What I will use this repository for:
* Display my knowledge using R programming language
* Via RStudio
* HTML
* Markdown
* Json
* SQL
* Github pages
